# How-To-Perform-Wholemount-Immunofluorescence-on-Zebrafish
# Summary:
This protocol is about immunofluorescence staining on zebrafish larvae. You can find detailed optimized protocols on this page. Immunofluorescent staining in zebrafish larvae is different from staining in cell culture. This protocol, which is optimized using multiple protocols, allows you to visualize the antibody of your choice in zebrafish larvae.
The overall goal of this method is to identify the relative abundance and location of interested protein.
# PROTOCOL 
1. Preparation of Solutions
   
   Prepare 100 ml of 1x PBST (1x PBS, 0.1% Tween-20), 1x PBST can be kept at room temperature (RT).
   
   Prepare 50 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in a chemical hood by dissolving powdered PFA in 1x PBS at 60 °C for 1 hr and covering it in aluminum foil to protect it from     light. Store at 4 °C for 1 month, or at -20 °C for 2 years.
   
   Prepare 100 ml of fresh 1x PDT (1x PBST, 0.3% Triton-X, 1% DMSO). 1x PDT can be stored at 4 °C for up to one month.
   
   Prepare 50 ml of blocking buffer (1x PBST, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2% bovine serum albumin). Create 10 ml aliquots, and store them at -20 °C for up to 1    year.
   
   Place 50 ml of 100% methanol at -20 °C.
   
2. Preparation of Embryos
   
   Collect zebrafish embryos in a Petri dish in an E3 medium.
   
   Transfer up to 20 embryos to a 1.5 ml tube. Rinse 2 times with 1 ml of 1x PBS.
   
   Remove 1x PBS, add 1 mL %4 PFA, and place it at 4°C for overnight.
   
3. Immunofluorescence Staining
   
   Remove PFA and rinse with 1X PBS.
   
   Dehydrate embryos with PBS/Methanol series. (%100 PBS, %75 PBS, %50 PBS, %25 PBS)
   
   Fixed with 1 mL ice-cold %100 MeOH at -20 °C for 2 hours or alternatively up to 24 hours.
   
   Remove methanol and add 1mL 1x PDT. Remove PDT, and add 1 ml of fresh 1x PDT placed the tube on a rack at RT for 30 mins.
   
   Remove PDT, and repeat 30 min wash with fresh PDT.
   
   Remove PDT add 500 uL blocking buffer and incubate for 1 hour at room temperature.
   
   End of the incubation add the primary antibody to the blocking buffer for example 1:500 dilution, add 1 uL to 500 uL blocking buffer.

   Embryos incubated overnight at 4°C.

   Remove block/antibody solution. Add 1 ml of 1x PDT.

   Carefully add 1mL 1x PDT. Remove PDT, and add 1 ml of fresh 1x PDT placed the tube on a rack at RT for 30 mins.
   
   Remove PDT, and repeat 30 min wash with fresh PDT.

   Remove PDT add 500 uL blocking buffer and incubate for 1 hour at room temperature.

   End of the incubation add the secondary antibody to the blocking buffer and incubate for 2 hours at room temperature.

   After secondary antibody incubation remove the solution and rinse 1X PBS.

   For counter stain use 1X DAPI. Embryos stain for 15 min with 1X DAPI.

   Finally, rinse embryos with 1X PBS 3 times for 5 min. Embryos are ready for imaging.
